    "- **Differencing**: To make the series stationary, we apply seasonal differencing (`.diff(12)`), which subtracts the value from the previous year. The ADF test on the differenced data gives a p-value less than 0.05, indicating the series is now stationary."

    "### Documenting and Fixing the Lag Error\\n",
    "\\n",
    "When plotting the ACF and PACF, an error can occur if the number of specified `lags` is too large relative to the number of data points in the series. Our seasonally differenced series (`Car_Sales_Diff`) has 36 observations. A common rule of thumb is that the number of lags should not exceed half of the observations (i.e., 36 / 2 = 18). The original code used `lags=20`, which violates this rule and would cause a `ValueError`.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "**The Fix:**\\n",
    "\\n",
    "We will reduce the number of lags from 20 to a more appropriate value, such as 15.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "**Why This Happens from a SARIMAX Perspective:**\\n",
    "\\n",
    "The ACF and PACF plots are fundamental tools for identifying the `p` and `q` parameters of a SARIMA model. These plots show the correlation of a time series with its own past values. To get a reliable estimate of these correlations, you need a sufficient number of data points. When you request too many lags for a short series, the correlation estimates for the higher lags become statistically unreliable because they are calculated with very few overlapping data points. This is why `statsmodels` raises an error.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "By choosing a smaller number of lags, we ensure that the ACF and PACF plots are both computable and interpretable, allowing us to make a more informed decision about the model's order."
